Switch lubrication represents one of the most impactful modifications in mechanical keyboard customization. Proper lubing transforms scratchy, inconsistent switches into smooth, refined instruments that enhance both typing feel and acoustic signature. This comprehensive guide covers everything from lubricant selection to advanced application techniques.

## Understanding Switch Lubrication Science

Lubrication reduces friction between moving components by creating microscopic films that separate metal and plastic surfaces. In mechanical switches, strategic lubricant application addresses multiple friction points while preserving essential switch characteristics.

### The Physics of Switch Friction

Mechanical switches generate friction through several contact points:
- **Stem rails against housing walls** during vertical travel
- **Spring coils** during compression and extension cycles
- **Leaf springs** maintaining electrical contact
- **Housing interfaces** where top and bottom sections meet

Different friction sources require targeted lubrication approaches. Over-lubrication can eliminate desired characteristics (like tactile bumps), while under-lubrication fails to address scratchiness and inconsistency.

### Lubricant Properties and Selection

Modern keyboard lubricants are specialized engineering compounds designed for specific applications. Understanding their properties enables informed selection for different switch types and desired outcomes.

**Viscosity Considerations:**
- **Thin oils** (like Krytox 105): Penetrate tight spaces, ideal for springs
- **Medium viscosity greases** (like Tribosys 3203): Balance flow and staying power
- **Thick greases** (like Krytox 205G0): Excellent for high-contact surfaces

**Temperature Stability:**
Quality keyboard lubricants maintain consistency across typical operating temperatures (-10°C to 60°C), ensuring reliable performance in various environments.

**Chemical Compatibility:**
Premium lubricants are formulated for compatibility with common switch materials (nylon, POM, polycarbonate, metals) without degradation over time.
