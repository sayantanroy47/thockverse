## VIA Basics: Your First Customizations

VIA's intuitive interface makes keyboard customization accessible to users without programming experience. Master these fundamentals before advancing to complex configurations.

### Interface Overview

**Main Window Elements:**
- **Keyboard layout display**: Visual representation of your keyboard
- **Keycode selection**: Available functions and keys for assignment
- **Layer tabs**: Access different keyboard layers
- **Macro editor**: Create and manage complex key sequences

**Key Assignment Process:**
1. Click the key you want to modify on the visual layout
2. Select desired function from keycode categories
3. Change takes effect immediately - test the modification
4. Repeat process for additional customizations

### Basic Key Remapping

**Simple Key Swaps:**
Transform your keyboard layout for improved ergonomics or language requirements:
- **Caps Lock to Escape**: Popular among programmers and vim users
- **Function key modifications**: Reprogram F-keys for media controls
- **International layouts**: Add accented characters and symbols

**Modifier Key Changes:**
Optimize modifier key placement for better ergonomics:
- **Control key placement**: Move Ctrl to more accessible positions
- **Alt/Option modifications**: Customize Alt key behavior for specific workflows
- **Windows/Command key**: Reprogram OS-specific keys for cross-platform use

### Layer System Fundamentals

**Understanding Layers:**
Layers provide multiple keyboard layouts accessible through key combinations. Think of layers as transparent sheets - when a key isn't defined on the active layer, the keyboard "falls through" to lower layers.

**Common Layer Strategies:**
- **Base layer (Layer 0)**: Standard typing layout for everyday use
- **Function layer (Layer 1)**: Media controls, function keys, navigation
- **Number layer (Layer 2)**: Numeric keypad functionality on compact keyboards
- **Symbol layer (Layer 3)**: Programming symbols and special characters

**Layer Activation Methods:**
- **Momentary activation (MO)**: Layer active only while key is held
- **Toggle activation (TG)**: Layer remains active until toggled off
- **One-shot layers (OSL)**: Layer active for single keypress then deactivates
- **Layer tap (LT)**: Key acts as modifier when held, different key when tapped

### Creating Your First Custom Layer

**Planning Your Layer:**
Before implementation, consider your specific needs:
- What functions do you use most frequently?
- Which keys are most accessible on your keyboard?
- How will layer activation fit into your typing flow?

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Select Layer 1 tab in VIA interface
2. Choose layer activation key (often Fn key or space bar)
3. Assign frequently used functions to easily accessible positions
4. Test layer functionality thoroughly before proceeding

**Example Function Layer Configuration:**
- **WASD**: Arrow key navigation
- **Q/E**: Home/End navigation
- **Number row**: F1-F10 function keys
- **Right side**: Media controls (play, pause, volume)

## Advanced VIA Features

Once comfortable with basic remapping, explore VIA's advanced features for sophisticated keyboard customization.

### Macro Creation and Management

**Macro Fundamentals:**
Macros automate repetitive text entry or complex key combinations. VIA macros support text strings, key combinations, and timing delays.

**Creating Simple Text Macros:**
1. Open Macros tab in VIA
2. Select empty macro slot (M0, M1, etc.)
3. Type desired text string in macro editor
4. Assign macro to keyboard key using "MACRO" keycode

**Advanced Macro Features:**
- **Timing delays**: {KC_DELAY,500} adds 500ms pause
- **Key combinations**: {KC_LCTRL,KC_C} for Ctrl+C
- **Mixed content**: Combine text strings with key combinations
- **Conditional logic**: Basic if/then functionality for complex behaviors

**Macro Best Practices:**
- Keep macros concise for reliability
- Test macros thoroughly before relying on them
- Use descriptive names for macro organization
- Back up macro configurations regularly

### Tap Dance and Advanced Key Behaviors

**Tap Dance Functionality:**
Tap Dance allows single keys to perform different actions based on tap patterns:
- **Single tap**: One action (e.g., normal key press)
- **Double tap**: Different action (e.g., shift + key)
- **Hold**: Third action (e.g., layer activation)

**Common Tap Dance Uses:**
- **Space/Shift**: Space on tap, Shift when held
- **Enter/Control**: Enter on tap, Control when held
- **Punctuation shortcuts**: Period on single tap, comma on double tap

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Tap Dance adds slight delay to key registration
- May not be suitable for rapid typing or gaming
- Test thoroughly to ensure reliable operation

### RGB and Lighting Control

**RGB Customization Options:**
VIA provides comprehensive RGB lighting control:
- **Static colors**: Set solid colors for aesthetic preferences
- **Dynamic effects**: Breathing, rainbow, and typing-reactive animations
- **Per-key customization**: Individual key color assignment
- **Layer-based lighting**: Different lighting for each keyboard layer

**Practical RGB Applications:**
- **Layer indicators**: Visual feedback for active layers
- **Caps Lock indication**: Obvious visual feedback for caps lock status
- **Gaming profiles**: Highlight gaming keys with distinct colors
- **Productivity aids**: Color-code different key functions

### Rotary Encoder Integration

**Encoder Functionality:**
Modern keyboards often include rotary encoders (volume knobs) that VIA can customize:
- **Default behavior**: Volume control and muting
- **Custom functions**: Brightness, scrolling, zoom control
- **Layer-specific behavior**: Different functions on different layers

**Programming Encoders:**
1. Locate encoder position in VIA layout
2. Assign functions to clockwise and counterclockwise rotation
3. Set encoder push button function if applicable
4. Test encoder behavior across all layers

## Command Line QMK: Advanced Customization

While VIA handles most customization needs, advanced users benefit from direct QMK programming for features beyond VIA's scope.

### QMK CLI Installation

**Setting Up QMK CLI:**
```bash
python3 -m pip install --user qmk

- **rules.mk**: Feature enablement and build options

**Basic Keymap Template:**
```c
#include QMK_KEYBOARD_H

const uint16_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {
    [0] = LAYOUT(
        KC_Q,    KC_W,    KC_E,    KC_R,    KC_T,
        KC_A,    KC_S,    KC_D,    KC_F,    KC_G,
        KC_Z,    KC_X,    KC_C,    KC_V,    KC_B
    ),
};
```

### Advanced QMK Features

};

bool process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
    switch (keycode) {
        case CUSTOM_KEY:
            if (record->event.pressed) {
                // Custom behavior here
            }
            return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```

**Advanced Layer Logic:**
Implement complex layer switching rules:
```c
layer_state_t layer_state_set_user(layer_state_t state) {
    return update_tri_layer_state(state, _LOWER, _RAISE, _ADJUST);
}
```
