The **Neo Oat switches** are part of the beloved breakfast switch series that has taken the mechanical keyboard community by storm. These linear switches promise a smooth, creamy typing experience that’s as satisfying as your morning bowl of oatmeal.

## First Impressions
Right out of the package, the Neo Oats make a statement with their distinctive cream-colored housing and brown POM stem. The aesthetic is subtle yet sophisticated, perfectly capturing the wholesome breakfast theme without being overly kitschy.

The factory lubing is immediately apparent when you first press the switch. There’s no scratchiness, no spring ping, just pure buttery smoothness that sets these switches apart from many competitors in the same price range.

### Build Quality &#x26; Materials
The Neo Oats feature a full nylon housing construction, which contributes significantly to their muted sound profile. The POM stem feels incredibly smooth against the nylon housing, creating minimal friction during keystroke travel.

**Material Breakdown:**


- **Top Housing**: Nylon (cream colored)
- **Bottom Housing**: Nylon (cream colored)
- **Stem**: POM (brown)
- **Springs**: Progressive 63.5g gold-plated

The 5-pin design includes sturdy plastic legs that provide excellent stability in plate-mount applications, though they work equally well in hotswap PCBs.

## Sound Profile: Creamy Morning Vibes
The Neo Oats produce a distinctly muted, creamy sound that’s perfect for shared workspaces or early morning typing sessions. Unlike sharper linear switches that can wake the household, these switches whisper rather than shout.

### Sound Characteristics:

- **Bottom-out**: Soft, muted thock
- **Upstroke**: Virtually silent
- **Overall tone**: Warm and subdued
- **Frequency**: Mid-to-low range

The nylon construction absorbs much of the higher frequencies, resulting in a sound profile that’s both satisfying and office-appropriate. It’s the audio equivalent of comfort food – familiar, pleasant, and never overwhelming.

## Typing Experience: Smooth as Butter
The 50g actuation force makes these switches incredibly easy to press, while the 63.5g bottom-out provides enough resistance to prevent accidental keypresses. The progressive spring design adds a subtle dynamic feel that keeps typing from feeling too linear or boring.

### Feel Characteristics:

- **Actuation**: Effortless and consistent
- **Travel**: Smooth throughout the entire stroke
- **Bottom-out**: Cushioned and satisfying
- **Wobble**: Minimal stem wobble in all directions

The factory lubing job is exceptional – easily rivaling many hand-lubed switches. The lubricant appears to be applied generously but not excessively, creating optimal smoothness without any mushiness.

## Comparison to Other Breakfast Switches
The breakfast switch family has become incredibly popular, and the Neo Oats hold their own against other members:


- **vs. Banana Splits**: Neo Oats are more muted and creamy, while Banana Splits have more pop
- **vs. Blueberries**: Neo Oats are linear vs. the tactile Blueberries, but share similar build quality
- **vs. Cereal switches**: Neo Oats offer better factory lubing and more premium feel

## Modding Potential
While the Neo Oats perform excellently stock, enthusiasts might consider:

### Recommended Mods:

- **Spring Swapping**: Try 67g springs for a slightly heavier feel
- **Filming**: TX films can further reduce any housing wobble
- **Additional Lubing**: Krytox 205g0 on housing, Krytox 105 on springs
- **Stem Swapping**: Experiment with different POM stems for varied feel

### Not Recommended:

- Heavy lubing (already well-lubed from factory)
- Housing swaps (the nylon construction is key to the sound profile)

## Value Proposition
At their current pricing, the Neo Oats occupy an interesting position in the linear switch market. They’re more expensive than basic switches like Gateron Yellows but offer significantly better factory lubing and materials.

**Price Comparison:**


- **Budget linears** ($0.30-0.50 per switch): Less smooth, require modding
- **Neo Oats** ($0.65-0.75 per switch): Premium feel, ready to use
- **Boutique linears** ($1.00+ per switch): Diminishing returns for most users

## Use Cases
The Neo Oats excel in several scenarios:


- **Office environments**: Quiet enough for shared spaces
- **Morning typing**: Perfect for early work sessions
- **Long typing sessions**: Comfortable actuation force
- **Stock builds**: No modding required for premium experience
- **Beginners**: Great introduction to premium linear switches

## Potential Drawbacks
No switch is perfect, and the Neo Oats have a few considerations:


- **Price**: Not budget-friendly for large keyboards
- **Availability**: Limited production runs through group buys
- **Sound preference**: May be too muted for those who prefer clacky switches
- **Spring weight**: 50g actuation might be too light for some users

## Final Verdict
The Neo Oat switches successfully deliver on their breakfast theme promise – they’re comforting, satisfying, and provide the perfect start to any typing session. The exceptional factory lubing, premium materials, and thoughtful design make them a standout choice in the crowded linear switch market.

For typists seeking a smooth, quiet, and premium linear switch experience without the hassle of extensive modding, the Neo Oats are absolutely worth the investment. They prove that themed switches can be more than just novelty – they can deliver genuine performance that justifies the premium.

**Bottom Line**: If you’re looking for linear switches that combine premium performance with office-friendly acoustics, the Neo Oats deserve serious consideration. They’re the mechanical keyboard equivalent of the perfect bowl of oatmeal – consistent, satisfying, and something you’ll never get tired of.
