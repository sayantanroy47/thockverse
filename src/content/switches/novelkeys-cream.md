The **NovelKeys Cream** switches stand unique in the mechanical switch landscape with their all-POM construction. Both housing and stem are made from polyoxymethylene (POM), creating self-lubricating properties and a distinctive sound profile that has earned a devoted following.

## The All-POM Design
Using POM for both housing and stem creates:


- Self-lubricating properties that improve over time
- Unique deep sound signature
- Exceptional durability
- Distinctive cream aesthetic

## Break-In Magic
Creams are famous for their break-in period. Initially scratchy, they transform over weeks of use into exceptionally smooth switches. This journey from rough to refined is part of their appeal.

## Sound Profile
The all-POM construction creates a uniquely deep, almost muted sound that many describe as “creamy.” It’s unlike any other switch material combination.

## Value Proposition
At $0.65 per switch, Creams offer unique properties at moderate prices.

**Pros:**


- Self-lubricating POM
- Unique sound
- Improves with use
- Distinctive aesthetic
- Good stock springs

**Cons:**


- Long break-in period
- Initially scratchy
- Inconsistent between batches
- Not immediately smooth

## Final Thoughts
NovelKeys Creams offer a unique experience that rewards patience. The break-in journey creates a personal connection many enthusiasts cherish.

**Bottom Line**: Unique switches that improve dramatically over time. Perfect for those who enjoy the break-in process.
