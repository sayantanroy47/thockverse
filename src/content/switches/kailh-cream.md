The **Kailh Cream** (not to be confused with NovelKeys Cream) offers Kailh’s take on all-POM construction with unique characteristics.

## Kailh’s POM Design
Kailh Creams feature:


- Different POM blend
- Heavier weight
- Unique sound
- Self-lubricating properties

**Pros:**


- Smooth after break-in
- Deep sound
- Unique feel
- Good value

**Cons:**


- Long break-in period
- Initially scratchy
- Confused with NK Creams

## Final Thoughts
Kailh Creams offer a different take on POM switches with their own character and benefits.

**Bottom Line**: Alternative POM switches that develop character through use.
