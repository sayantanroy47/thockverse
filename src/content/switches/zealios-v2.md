The **Zealios V2 67g** represents the pinnacle of tactile switch design. Created by ZealPC specifically for enthusiasts seeking maximum tactility without the noise of clicky switches, these purple beauties deliver a tactile experience that many consider endgame-worthy.

## First Impressions
Zealios V2s announce their premium nature immediately. The distinctive purple housing and stem create a unique aesthetic, while the first press reveals an incredibly pronounced tactile bump that starts at the very top of the keystroke. This isn’t subtle tactility – it’s a bold, confident bump that leaves no doubt about actuation.

### Build Quality
ZealPC’s attention to detail is evident throughout. Tolerances are exceptionally tight with virtually no stem wobble. The factory lubrication is carefully applied to maintain smoothness without diminishing tactility. Each switch feels identical, with consistent tactile response across entire batches.

## Sound Profile
Despite the strong tactility, Zealios V2s remain relatively quiet. The sound is a muted thock with the tactile event adding a subtle complexity. They’re office-friendly while providing maximum feedback.

## The Tactile Experience
The V2 redesign moved the tactile bump to the very top of the keystroke, creating a unique feel:


- Immediate tactile feedback
- Large, rounded bump
- Smooth drop after the bump
- Cushioned bottom-out
- Strong return force

This creates a typing rhythm unlike any other switch – deliberate, confident, and deeply satisfying for tactile enthusiasts.

## Value Proposition
At $1.00-1.20 per switch, Zealios V2s are expensive but deliver unique performance.

**Pros:**


- Maximum tactility
- Exceptional build quality
