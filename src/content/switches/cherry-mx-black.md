The **Cherry MX Black** holds a special place in mechanical keyboard history as Cherry’s original linear switch, predating even the popular MX Red. These heavy linears have developed a cult following, particularly among vintage keyboard enthusiasts who prize the superior smoothness of older “vintage Black” switches manufactured in the 1980s and 1990s.

## First Impressions
Cherry MX Blacks immediately feel substantial. The all-black aesthetic – black stem in black housing – gives them a serious, professional appearance. The first press reveals their defining characteristic: significant resistance that demands deliberate action. These aren’t switches for the light-fingered; they require confident, purposeful keystrokes.

### Build Quality
Cherry’s industrial heritage shines through in MX Blacks. The construction is robust and overbuilt, designed for decades of reliable service. The heavier spring provides additional stability, reducing wobble and creating a more solid typing platform. Tolerances are typically excellent, though vintage examples often exceed modern production in smoothness.

## Sound Profile
MX Blacks produce a deep, muted sound signature that many describe as refined. The heavier spring and controlled movement create less high-frequency noise than lighter switches, resulting in a more bass-heavy acoustic profile.

### Sound Test Comparison
The heavy weighting influences sound across different configurations:


- **Aluminum plates**: Deep, controlled thock with minimal ping
- **PC plates**: Exceptionally muted with rounded bottom-out
- **Carbon fiber plates**: Unique deep resonance with clean return
- **Brass plates**: Premium, weighty sound matching the switch character
- **Steel plates**: Industrial sound with controlled resonance
- **POM plates**: Maximum depth with creamy acoustics

The controlled movement from heavy springs means less variability in sound between gentle and aggressive typing.

## Typing Experience
### Smoothness
Modern Cherry MX Blacks exhibit typical Cherry scratchiness when stock, though less noticeable than lighter variants due to the heavier spring overpowering minor friction. Vintage Blacks, particularly those from the 1980s-1990s West German production, are legendarily smooth, often rivaling modern premium linears without any modification.

### Feel
The 60g actuation and 80g bottom-out forces create a typing experience that demands attention. Every keystroke requires deliberate effort, which can significantly reduce typing errors from accidental actuations. The heavy weighting creates a rhythm – you can’t mindlessly mash keys but must develop a purposeful typing cadence.

For users accustomed to lighter switches, the initial experience can be fatiguing. However, many who persist find the controlled, deliberate nature improves their typing form and reduces long-term strain by encouraging proper finger positioning and movement.

## The Vintage Black Phenomenon
Vintage Cherry MX Blacks have achieved legendary status in the enthusiast community. Switches manufactured in Cherry’s original West German facility during the 1980s and early 1990s possess a smoothness that modern production hasn’t replicated. Theories abound:


- Different mold tooling with tighter tolerances
- Alternative plastic formulations
- Natural break-in from decades of use
- Different production equipment and processes

Whatever the cause, vintage Blacks command premium prices and are highly sought after for custom builds. They’re often harvested from old terminal keyboards and carefully restored for modern use.

## Modding Potential
MX Blacks are excellent modding candidates, particularly vintage examples.

### Lubing
Lubrication dramatically improves modern MX Blacks:


- **Krytox 205g0** eliminates scratchiness completely
- **Vintage Blacks** often need minimal lubing, just spring treatment
- **GPL 105** on springs eliminates any ping
- Heavy springs mean you can use thicker lubes without sluggishness

### Filming
Films can improve sound and feel:


- **TX 0.15mm films** tighten housings effectively
- Vintage Blacks often have tighter tolerances, requiring thinner films
- Sound deepens noticeably with proper filming
- Reduces any remaining wobble

### Spring Swapping
The heavy springs define MX Blacks, but alternatives exist:


- **Progressive 63.5g springs** maintain character with easier actuation
- **Korean stainless steel springs** for premium feel
- **Ultra-heavy 90g+ springs** for maximum resistance
- Lighter springs fundamentally change the switch character

## Gaming Performance
For gaming, MX Blacks are divisive. The heavy weighting prevents accidental inputs and provides precise control for deliberate movements. Some professional gamers prefer them for this reason – every input is intentional. However, rapid repeated inputs become fatiguing quickly, making them challenging for spam-heavy games or extended sessions.

They excel in simulation games, strategy titles, and anything requiring precise, deliberate inputs rather than rapid-fire key presses.

## Typing Dynamics
MX Blacks enforce good typing habits. The resistance prevents bottom-out hammering, encouraging users to develop a flowing technique that uses the spring resistance for key return. Touch typists often find their accuracy improves after adjusting to the weight.

The heavy springs provide excellent return force, snapping keys back to position authoritatively. This creates a responsive feel despite the weight, with keys ready for the next input immediately.

## Workplace Suitability
MX Blacks are excellent office switches for those who can handle the weight. They’re quiet, professional, and the heavy weighting prevents accidental inputs during focused work. The deep sound signature is unobtrusive, and the controlled nature means consistent noise levels regardless of typing intensity.

## Value Proposition
Modern MX Blacks price similarly to other Cherry switches at $0.30-0.40 each. Vintage Blacks command significantly higher prices, often $1-2 per switch or more for verified authentic examples.

**Pros:**


- Controlled, deliberate typing experience
- Reduces accidental actuations
- Deep, refined sound signature
- Excellent for developing proper technique
- Vintage versions are exceptionally smooth
- Great modding potential
- Professional aesthetic

**Cons:**


- Fatiguing for extended use
- Too heavy for many users
- Challenging for gaming
- Modern versions can be scratchy
- Vintage versions are expensive and rare
- Not beginner-friendly

## Break-in Period
MX Blacks benefit significantly from break-in. The heavy springs and tight tolerances mean initial scratchiness diminishes with use. Many users report noticeable smoothness improvements after several weeks of regular use. This natural break-in process contributes to the appeal of vintage examples.

## Modern Production vs Vintage
Current Cherry MX Blacks are good switches but lack the magic of vintage examples. Modern production is consistent and reliable but doesn’t achieve the buttery smoothness of broken-in vintage switches. For builders seeking the vintage experience without the cost, heavily modded modern Blacks can approximate it.

## Alternative Considerations
For those seeking heavy linears with modern refinements:


- **Gateron Black Inks** offer premium smoothness at lower weights
- **Nixdorf Black** vintage switches for similar character
- **Cherry MX Linear Grey** for even heavier weighting
- **Gateron Black** for budget-friendly alternatives
- **JWK/Durock linears** in heavier spring weights

## Cultural Impact
MX Blacks have influenced mechanical keyboard culture significantly. The vintage Black phenomenon sparked interest in switch collecting and restoration. They’ve inspired numerous modern switches attempting to capture their character with contemporary manufacturing techniques.

## Final Thoughts
Cherry MX Blacks are switches of conviction. They demand commitment from users – commitment to developing proper technique, building finger strength, and appreciating a more deliberate typing experience. They’re not for everyone, and that’s precisely their appeal.

For users who find lighter switches unsatisfying or error-prone, MX Blacks offer control and precision. The heavy weighting transforms typing from a casual activity into an intentional act. Every word typed feels substantial, every keystroke meaningful.

Vintage Blacks remain among the finest linear switches ever produced, worth seeking out for special builds. Modern Blacks, while not achieving the same heights, still offer a unique experience that many users find irreplaceable once adapted.

**Bottom Line**: Cherry MX Blacks are uncompromising heavy linears that reward dedication with a controlled, refined typing experience. Not for casual users, but potentially perfect for those seeking deliberate, precise input with vintage character.
