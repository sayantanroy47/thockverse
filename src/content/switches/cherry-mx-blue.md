The **Cherry MX Blue** is perhaps the most recognizable mechanical switch in existence, famous for its distinctive click sound and pronounced tactile bump. These switches have introduced countless users to the world of mechanical keyboards, offering an typing experience that’s both nostalgic and deeply satisfying for those who appreciate auditory and tactile feedback.

## First Impressions
Cherry MX Blues immediately announce their presence the moment you press a key. The distinctive blue stem hints at the acoustic experience to come, while the standard Cherry black housing ensures compatibility with virtually any keyboard. The build quality is immediately apparent, with each switch feeling solid and precisely manufactured.

### Build Quality
Cherry’s manufacturing prowess is evident in the MX Blues’ construction. The two-piece slider mechanism that creates the click is precisely engineered, ensuring consistent tactile feedback and sound across every switch. The housing tolerances are tight, minimizing stem wobble while allowing smooth operation of the click mechanism. Like all Cherry switches, these are rated for 50 million actuations, though the click mechanism adds a layer of complexity compared to linear variants.

## Sound Profile
The Cherry MX Blue’s sound is its defining characteristic – a sharp, high-pitched click on both actuation and release. This isn’t just key noise; it’s a deliberate acoustic signal that confirms each keystroke. The click is crisp and pronounced, cutting through ambient noise with authority.

### Sound Test Comparison
Different plate materials significantly affect the MX Blue’s acoustic signature:


- **Aluminum plates**: Amplifies the click with metallic resonance, creating a sharper, more penetrating sound
- **PC plates**: Slightly dampens the click while adding a deeper bottom-out thud
- **Carbon fiber plates**: Produces a unique hollow click with interesting harmonics
- **Brass plates**: Adds weight and depth to the click, creating a more premium sound
- **Steel plates**: Maximum resonance and volume, perfect for those who want maximum clickiness
- **FR4 plates**: Balanced sound with natural dampening that takes the edge off the sharpness

The click mechanism produces sound independently of the bottom-out, meaning you get consistent acoustic feedback whether you bottom out or not. This makes them excellent for touch typists who can actuate without bottoming out.

## Typing Experience
### Smoothness
Cherry MX Blues aren’t about smoothness – they’re about feedback. The tactile bump and click mechanism create deliberate interruptions in the keystroke that some find addictive. There’s inherent scratchiness from the slider mechanism, and the tactile bump adds resistance that varies through the keystroke. This isn’t a bug; it’s the entire feature set.

### Feel
The 50g actuation force combined with the tactile bump creates a unique typing rhythm. The bump occurs just before actuation, providing clear physical feedback about when the switch has registered. After clearing the bump, the switch drops to bottom-out with reduced resistance. This creates a satisfying “typewriter-like” feel that many writers and programmers adore.

The tactile feedback helps reduce typing errors by providing clear confirmation of actuation. You know exactly when each key has registered, both through feel and sound. This can actually increase typing speed once you develop the rhythm, as you can move to the next key with confidence.

## Modding Potential
While Cherry MX Blues can be modded, the click mechanism limits options compared to linear switches.

### Lubing
Lubrication must be applied carefully to avoid dampening the click:


- **Avoid the click mechanism entirely** – lube here will quiet or eliminate the click
- **Light application of Krytox 205g0** on the stem rails can reduce scratchiness
- **Spring lubing with Krytox 105** eliminates spring ping without affecting the click
- **Contact leaves** should never be lubed as it affects the click mechanism

Many enthusiasts prefer to keep MX Blues stock to preserve their characteristic sound and feel.

### Filming
The click mechanism makes filming more complex:


- Films can interfere with the click mechanism if too thick
- **0.125mm films** maximum thickness recommended
- Many users find filming unnecessary or detrimental to the click quality
- The added complexity often isn’t worth the minimal improvement

### Spring Swapping
Spring swaps can alter the feel significantly:


- **Lighter springs (35-45g)** make the tactile bump more pronounced
- **Heavier springs (60-80g)** can overwhelm the tactile bump
- **Progressive springs** can enhance the tactile experience
- The click mechanism limits extreme modifications

## Compatibility and Installation
Cherry MX Blues share the same universal compatibility as all MX-style switches. They’re available in both 3-pin and 5-pin configurations, working with any MX-compatible PCB and plate. The standard stem accepts all MX-compatible keycaps without issue.

### RGB Performance
The opaque black housing blocks RGB completely in the standard version. Cherry does offer an RGB variant with a clear top housing that allows for light transmission while maintaining the same click mechanism and feel. The clear version slightly alters the sound signature, typically making it a bit higher pitched.

## Workplace Considerations
Let’s address the elephant in the room: Cherry MX Blues are loud. Very loud. Your coworkers will hear every keystroke, and opinions will be divided. Some find the rhythmic clicking soothing and productive, while others find it unbearably distracting. These are not switches for open offices, shared spaces, or late-night typing while others sleep.

The volume isn’t just about consideration for others – it can affect your own experience. Video calls become challenging without a good noise-canceling microphone, and the clicks can be picked up by sensitive recording equipment.

## Value Proposition
Priced similarly to other Cherry MX switches at $0.30-0.40 per switch, MX Blues offer good value for those seeking a genuine clicky experience. They’re more affordable than many boutique clicky options while maintaining Cherry’s renowned quality standards.

**Pros:**


- Distinctive and satisfying click mechanism
- Excellent tactile feedback for typing
- Reduces typing errors with clear actuation point
- Proven reliability and durability
- Universal compatibility
- Creates engaging typing experience
- Industry-standard quality

**Cons:**


- Extremely loud for shared environments
- Not suitable for gaming due to tactile bump
- Click mechanism can develop inconsistencies over time
- Limited modding potential
- Can cause fatigue during extended use
- Scratchier than modern alternatives

## Typing Dynamics
Cherry MX Blues excel at transforming typing into an engaging, almost musical experience. The click creates a rhythm that many typists find helps them maintain consistent speed and accuracy. The tactile bump provides confidence in each keystroke, reducing the need to bottom out and potentially reducing finger fatigue despite the higher actuation force.

Writers particularly appreciate MX Blues for their feedback-rich experience. The clicks create a sense of productivity – each sound is progress made, words written, code compiled. This psychological aspect shouldn’t be underestimated; many users report increased focus and satisfaction when using clicky switches.

## Gaming Performance
For gaming, Cherry MX Blues are controversial. The tactile bump that makes them excellent for typing becomes a liability in gaming scenarios. The bump must be overcome for each actuation, making rapid double-taps more difficult. The reset point is above the actuation point, meaning you must let the key rise significantly before pressing again.

Some gamers enjoy MX Blues for slower-paced games or MMOs where the tactile feedback helps confirm ability usage. However, for competitive FPS or games requiring rapid inputs, most players prefer linear switches.

## Long-term Reliability
While Cherry rates MX Blues for 50 million actuations, the click mechanism adds a potential failure point. Over time, some switches may develop inconsistent clicks, reduced tactility, or in rare cases, loss of click entirely. However, these issues typically only appear after years of heavy use, and Cherry’s quality control means complete failures are rare.

The click mechanism can also accumulate dust and debris more readily than simpler linear designs. Regular cleaning with compressed air helps maintain consistent performance.

## Alternative Considerations
For those seeking a clicky experience with modern refinements, several alternatives exist:


- **Kailh Box White/Jade** offer click-bar mechanisms with different sound profiles
- **Gateron Blue** provides a similar experience at a lower price point
- **NovelKeys Sherbet** offers a lighter, more refined click
- **Outemu Blue** for extreme budget builds

Each offers different takes on the clicky formula, though Cherry MX Blues remain the standard by which others are measured.

## Final Thoughts
Cherry MX Blue switches are polarizing by design. They’re not trying to be quiet, smooth, or suitable for every situation. Instead, they excel at providing maximum feedback through both tactile and auditory channels. For the right user in the right environment, they’re absolutely perfect.

If you work alone, love the sound of typing, and want switches that make every keystroke feel significant, Cherry MX Blues are hard to beat. They transform typing from a mundane task into an engaging experience. The reliability, compatibility, and widespread availability make them a safe choice for those seeking their first clicky switch.

However, be honest about your environment and use case. If you share space with others, game competitively, or need to type during video calls, look elsewhere. The MX Blue experience is uncompromising – you either embrace the click entirely or choose something else.

**Bottom Line**: Cherry MX Blues are the definitive clicky switch experience. They’re loud, tactile, and absolutely perfect for solo typists who want maximum feedback. Not for everyone, but absolutely beloved by those who appreciate what they offer.
