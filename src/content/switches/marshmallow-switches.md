**Marshmallow switches** are the latest offering from the creative minds behind the Campfire switch series. These ultra-light linear switches promise a typing experience as soft and bouncy as their namesake confection, targeting users who prefer feather-light keystrokes and rapid-fire gaming performance.

## Visual Design: Campfire Aesthetic
The Marshmallow switches immediately catch the eye with their pristine white and translucent design. The polycarbonate top housing is crystal clear, allowing RGB lighting to shine through beautifully, while the nylon bottom housing provides a subtle cream accent that perfectly captures the marshmallow aesthetic.

The white POM stem completes the look, creating a cohesive design that would look right at home in a s’mores-themed build. The attention to aesthetic detail is impressive – these switches look exactly like what you’d expect from something called “Marshmallow.”

### RGB Performance
The clear PC top housing makes these switches exceptional for RGB builds. Light transmission is excellent, with colors appearing vibrant and evenly distributed. The white stem and housing create a nice diffusion effect that prevents hotspots while maintaining color accuracy.

## The Pillowy Experience
At just 35g actuation force, the Marshmallows are among the lightest switches we’ve tested. The sensation is immediately noticeable – these switches activate with barely a whisper of pressure, making them ideal for users with lighter touch typing styles or those suffering from finger fatigue.

### Feel Characteristics:

- **Ultra-light**: 35g actuation feels almost weightless
- **Bouncy return**: The slow-curve springs provide a unique rebound
- **Smooth travel**: Factory lubing eliminates any scratchiness
- **Gentle bottom-out**: 45g bottom-out feels cushioned and soft

The “pillowy” descriptor is surprisingly accurate. There’s a softness to the entire keystroke that’s difficult to describe – it’s as if each keypress is being cushioned by an invisible layer of marshmallow fluff.

## Sound Profile: Whisper Quiet
Don’t expect any dramatic thocking with the Marshmallows. These switches prioritize subtlety over acoustic drama, producing a soft, muted sound that’s perfect for late-night gaming sessions or shared workspaces.

### Acoustic Analysis:

- **Bottom-out**: Gentle, muted tap
- **Upstroke**: Nearly silent
- **Frequency range**: Mid-range with minimal high-end presence
- **Volume**: Exceptionally quiet

The combination of the PC top and nylon bottom creates an interesting hybrid sound profile. The PC adds a subtle brightness while the nylon bottom absorbs harsh frequencies, resulting in a pleasant, non-fatiguing acoustic signature.

## Performance Testing
We put the Marshmallows through extensive testing across various use cases:

### Gaming Performance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Exceptional for competitive gaming.** The ultra-light actuation force allows for rapid key presses with minimal finger fatigue. Perfect for games requiring quick reactions or rapid-fire inputs. Professional gamers and speed typists will appreciate the reduced effort required.

### Typing Performance: ⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Great for light typists, challenging for heavy-handed users.** The light actuation can lead to accidental keypresses if you’re used to heavier switches. However, once adjusted, the typing experience is surprisingly pleasant and comfortable for long sessions.

### Office Use: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
**Perfect office companions.** The quiet operation makes these ideal for shared workspaces. Colleagues won’t be disturbed by your typing, making them excellent for professional environments.

## Technical Deep Dive
### Spring Design
The Marshmallows use a unique slow-curve spring design that provides most of its resistance near the end of travel. This creates the characteristic “pillowy” feel where initial actuation is extremely light, but bottom-out has a gentle cushion.

### Factory Lubing
The factory lubing job is thorough and well-executed. Krytox 205g0 appears to be used on the stem rails and housing, while the springs receive a light coat of Krytox 105. The lubing enhances the smoothness without making the switches feel mushy.

### Tolerances
Housing tolerances are tight with minimal wobble in any direction. The POM stem fits precisely within the housing, contributing to the overall premium feel despite the ultra-light weight.

## Modding Considerations
### Recommended Modifications:

- **Spring swapping**: Consider 50g or 55g springs if the stock weight is too light
- **Filming**: TX films can further reduce any micro-wobble
- **Stem lubing**: Additional 205g0 on stem for even more smoothness

### Avoid:

- Heavy lubing (already well-lubed from factory)
- Lighter springs (will make accidental actuation worse)
- Housing swaps (the hybrid PC/nylon combo is key to the sound)

## Compatibility &#x26; Build Considerations
The Marshmallows work well with most keycap profiles, though the light actuation force pairs particularly well with:


- **Low-profile keycaps**: Reduces key travel and weight
- **Gaming keycaps**: Take advantage of the quick actuation
- **Artisan keycaps**: Light force prevents fatigue when using heavier caps

### Recommended Builds:

- Gaming keyboards (60%, 65%, TKL)
- Office boards with silent requirements
- Speed typing builds
- RGB showcase builds

## Value Analysis
At approximately $0.70 per switch, the Marshmallows sit in the premium category but offer unique characteristics that justify the price for the right user. They’re not just another linear switch – they provide a genuinely different typing experience.

**Comparison Value:**


- **Unique feel**: No other switch quite replicates the pillowy sensation
- **Premium materials**: PC/nylon hybrid housing, quality POM stem
- **Excellent factory prep**: Minimal modding required
- **Aesthetic appeal**: Perfect for themed builds

## Who Should Buy Marshmallows?
### Ideal For:

- **Competitive gamers** seeking ultra-fast actuation
- **Light typists** who prefer minimal finger pressure
- **Office workers** needing quiet operation
- **RGB enthusiasts** wanting excellent light transmission
- **Users with finger/hand fatigue** issues

### Not Ideal For:

- **Heavy typists** who might activate keys accidentally
- **Thock lovers** seeking dramatic acoustic feedback
- **Budget builders** (premium pricing)
- **Traditional linear fans** preferring standard actuation forces

## Final Thoughts
The Marshmallow switches succeed in delivering exactly what they promise – a pillowy, ultra-light typing experience that’s genuinely unique in the current switch landscape. While they won’t appeal to everyone, they fill a specific niche exceptionally well.

The build quality is excellent, the aesthetics are on-point, and the performance delivers on the marketing claims. For users seeking the lightest possible linear experience with premium materials and execution, the Marshmallows are hard to beat.

**Bottom Line**: The Marshmallow switches are a successful experiment in ultra-light linear design. They prove that innovation in switch design doesn’t always mean more force or louder sounds – sometimes the most interesting direction is toward ultimate gentleness. If you’ve ever wondered what typing on clouds might feel like, these switches are probably the closest you’ll get.
