The **Tealios V2** sets the benchmark for linear switch smoothness. Using ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) stems, these switches achieve a level of smoothness that many consider the absolute pinnacle of linear switch design.

## The UHMWPE Advantage
The UHMWPE stem material provides:


- Self-lubricating properties
- Incredibly low coefficient of friction
- Exceptional durability
- Consistent smoothness over time

## Typing Experience
Tealios V2s feel like typing on air. The smoothness is so exceptional that first-time users often express disbelief. There’s zero scratchiness, zero texture – just pure, frictionless linear travel.

## Value Proposition
At $1.20-1.40 per switch, Tealios V2s are among the most expensive switches available.

**Pros:**


- Unmatched smoothness
- Premium materials
- Excellent consistency
- Beautiful aesthetic
- Endgame performance

**Cons:**


- Extremely expensive
- Smoothness may feel “characterless”
- Limited availability
- Overkill for many users

## Final Thoughts
Tealios V2s are the ultimate expression of linear smooth. For those seeking the absolute best, they’re worth every penny.

**Bottom Line**: The smoothest linear switches in existence. Expensive but delivers genuinely unique performance.
