# The Wait is Over
After 8 long months of being out of stock everywhere, Gateron Oil King switches are finally available again. These aren’t just any linear switches – they’re the ones that redefined what factory-lubed switches could be and set a new standard for smoothness straight out of the box.

## Why Oil Kings Became Legendary
When Gateron first released Oil Kings in 2023, they immediately became the gold standard for premium linear switches:

### Unmatched Smoothness

- **Factory lubed** with high-quality lubricant
- **INK housing material** for reduced friction
- **Tight tolerances** that eliminate scratchiness

### That Deep Thock Sound
Oil Kings are famous for their acoustic signature:


- **Deep, resonant thock** on bottoming out
- **Minimal spring ping** thanks to quality springs
- **Rich bass frequencies** that sound amazing in any board

## What’s New in the 2025 Batch?
Our testing of the new stock reveals some subtle improvements:

### Manufacturing Refinements

- **Even tighter tolerances** on stem wobble
- **Improved spring consistency** across batches
- **Better factory lubing** with more even application

### Quality Control

- **Zero scratchy switches** in our 110-switch sample
- **Consistent actuation force** within ±2g tolerance
- **Perfect electrical contact** on all switches tested

## Sound and Feel Analysis
Our comprehensive testing setup reveals why Oil Kings remain special:

### Acoustic Properties
Sound Profile:
- Dominant frequency: 150-200Hz (deep thock)
- Minimal high-frequency noise
- Clean sound signature with no rattling
- Perfect for ASMR typing videos
### Tactile Characteristics

- **Buttery smooth** travel with no scratchiness
- **Consistent actuation** across all switches
- **Minimal stem wobble** for precise keypresses
- **Perfect spring return** with no binding

## Build Compatibility
Oil Kings work exceptionally well in various setups:

### Best Plate Materials

- **PC plates** for maximum thock
- **FR4 plates** for balanced sound
- **Aluminum plates** for crisp response

### Recommended Keyboards

- **Gasket mount boards** (Mode65, Jelly Epoch)
- **Top mount boards** (Tofu65, NK65)
- **Tray mount boards** (surprisingly good!)

## Lubing: Necessary or Not?
One of Oil Kings’ biggest advantages is their excellent factory lubing:

### Stock Performance

- **9/10 smoothness** right out of the box
- **Consistent feel** across all switches
- **No break-in period** required

### Custom Lubing
If you want to customize further:


- **Krytox 205g0** for even smoother feel
- **Spring lubing** can reduce any remaining ping
- **Films not recommended** – housing is already tight

## Pricing and Availability
The good news: pricing remains reasonable despite the long shortage.

### Current Pricing

- **$0.75 per switch** at major retailers
- **Bulk discounts** available for 110+ switches
- **Free shipping** on orders over $50

### Where to Buy

- **KBDfans** – In stock, ships from China
- **Divinikey** – US stock, fast shipping
- **MechBoards UK** – European distribution

## The Verdict
After 8 months of waiting, Oil Kings prove they’re still worth the hype. The 2025 batch maintains everything that made these switches legendary while adding subtle refinements that make them even better.

For anyone building a linear board in 2025, Oil Kings should be at the top of your list. They offer premium performance at a reasonable price, with factory lubing that rivals custom jobs.

**Rating: 9.3/10** – Still the king of factory-lubed linears.
