The **Gateron Black Ink V2** represents Gateron’s assault on the premium linear switch market. Using proprietary INK material for both housing and stem, these switches deliver exceptional smoothness and a unique sound signature that has earned them a devoted following among enthusiasts willing to pay for excellence.

## First Impressions
Black Ink V2s immediately feel special. The smoky translucent housing has a premium appearance, while the proprietary INK material creates a distinct feel from the first press. These switches glide with a smoothness that rivals any linear on the market, with a satisfying weight that feels substantial without being fatiguing.

### Build Quality
Gateron’s premium manufacturing shines in the Ink V2s. Tolerances are exceptional, with minimal stem wobble and perfectly consistent feel across batches. The INK material’s self-lubricating properties combined with factory lubrication create an immediately smooth experience. The V2 improvements addressed the minor issues of the original, resulting in near-perfect consistency.

## Sound Profile
Black Ink V2s produce a unique sound – deeper than typical switches but with a characteristic “inky” quality that’s hard to describe but immediately recognizable. It’s smooth, refined, and slightly muted without being dull. The proprietary material creates acoustic properties unlike traditional nylon or polycarbonate housings.

### Sound Test Comparison
The INK material creates consistent excellence across configurations:


- **Aluminum plates**: Clean, deep sound with minimal ping
- **PC plates**: Exceptional depth with rounded edges
- **Carbon fiber plates**: Unique resonance with the INK material
- **Brass plates**: Premium combination of materials
- **POM plates**: Ultimate smoothness in sound and feel

## Typing Experience
### Smoothness
This is where Black Ink V2s earn their reputation. The combination of INK material’s self-lubricating properties and quality factory lubrication creates butter-smooth travel from day one. Many users report these as the smoothest stock switches they’ve tried, rivaling heavily modified alternatives.

### Feel
The 60g actuation and 70g bottom-out provide satisfying resistance without being heavy. The force curve is perfectly linear, with no unexpected variations. The INK material creates a unique sensation – simultaneously soft and firm, cushioned yet responsive.

## The INK Advantage
The proprietary INK material differentiates these from standard switches:


- Self-lubricating properties maintain smoothness
- Unique acoustic characteristics
- Exceptional durability
- Distinctive feel unlike other materials
- Better temperature stability

## Modding Potential
While excellent stock, Black Ink V2s can be further refined:

### Lubing
Already smooth, but can be enhanced:


- Light **Krytox 205g0** application for perfection
- Many users find stock lubrication sufficient
- Over-lubing can diminish the unique INK feel

### Filming
Generally unnecessary due to tight tolerances:


- Very thin films (0.1mm) if any wobble exists
- Most users skip filming entirely
- Can slightly alter the distinctive sound

## Value Proposition
At $0.75-0.85 per switch, Black Ink V2s are premium-priced but deliver premium performance.

**Pros:**


- Exceptional smoothness
- Unique, pleasant sound
- Premium materials and construction
- Excellent consistency
- Self-lubricating properties
- Minimal modding needed

**Cons:**


- High price point
- Limited availability
- May be too smooth for some
- Unique feel not for everyone

## Final Thoughts
Gateron Black Ink V2s justify their premium pricing with genuinely premium performance. For enthusiasts seeking exceptional smoothness and unique character, they’re worth every penny.

**Bottom Line**: Premium switches that deliver premium performance. The smoothness and unique INK feeling make them endgame-worthy for linear enthusiasts.
