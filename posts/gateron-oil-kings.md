The **Gateron Oil Kings** have quickly become one of the most talked-about linear switches in the mechanical keyboard community, and for good reason. These switches deliver that coveted *thock* sound that enthusiasts crave, wrapped in a beautifully designed housing that looks as good as it sounds.

## First Impressions
Right out of the box, the Oil Kings make a statement. The smoky translucent housing gives these switches a premium appearance that rivals much more expensive alternatives. The black POM stem contrasts beautifully with the housing, creating an aesthetic that works well in both RGB and non-RGB builds.

### Build Quality
Gateron has clearly put significant effort into the manufacturing quality of these switches. The tolerances are tight, with minimal wobble in both the north-south and east-west directions. This translates to a more consistent typing experience and better keycap compatibility across different profiles.

## Sound Profile
This is where the Oil Kings truly shine. The sound signature is distinctly *thocky* – a deep, resonant bottom-out that’s music to the ears of linear switch enthusiasts. Unlike the higher-pitched *clack* of switches like Cherry MX Reds, the Oil Kings produce a more muted, bass-heavy tone that works exceptionally well in both quiet office environments and home setups.

### Sound Test Comparison
In our extensive sound tests across different plate materials and case types:


- **Aluminum plates**: Crisp thock with excellent resonance
- **PC plates**: Deeper, more muted tone
- **Carbon fiber plates**: Balanced thock with slight metallic overtones

The factory lubing contributes significantly to the sound profile, eliminating the spring ping that often plagues stock switches while maintaining the characteristic deep tone.

## Typing Experience
### Smoothness
The Oil Kings offer exceptional smoothness straight from the factory. The combination of the POM stem and nylon/ink housing creates a buttery-smooth keystroke that rivals many hand-lubed switches. There’s virtually no scratchiness, even on fresh switches straight from the packaging.

### Feel
The 45g actuation force makes these switches very easy to press, while the 60g bottom-out provides enough resistance to prevent accidental key presses. The travel distance of 2.0mm to actuation and 4.0mm total is perfectly standard for Cherry MX-style switches, making them compatible with any standard keycap set.

## Modding Potential
While the Oil Kings perform excellently stock, there’s still room for improvement for enthusiasts who enjoy modding:

### Lubing
Although factory-lubed, adding Krytox 205g0 to the stem and housing can further enhance smoothness. The factory lube job is conservative, leaving room for enthusiasts to fine-tune to their preferences.

### Filming
TX switch films can help reduce housing wobble even further and potentially alter the sound signature slightly. We found 0.15mm films work best without causing binding issues.

### Spring Swapping
The stock springs are well-tuned, but enthusiasts might consider:


- **Progressive springs** for a more dynamic feel
- **Lighter springs (43g)** for gaming applications
- **Heavier springs (67g)** for typing-focused builds

## Compatibility and Installation
The Oil Kings are available in both 3-pin and 5-pin variants, making them compatible with virtually any PCB. The 5-pin versions include additional plastic legs for enhanced stability in plate-mount applications.

### RGB Performance
The smoky housing provides excellent RGB diffusion while maintaining the premium aesthetic. Colors appear slightly muted compared to clear housings, which many users prefer for a more sophisticated look.

## Value Proposition
At their current market price, the Oil Kings occupy an interesting position in the linear switch landscape. They’re more expensive than basic Gateron Yellows but significantly cheaper than premium boutique switches like Tangerines or Alpacas.

**Pros:**


- Excellent thocky sound signature
- Smooth factory feel
- Beautiful aesthetic
- Good RGB compatibility
- Minimal stem wobble

**Cons:**


- Higher price point than basic linears
- Limited color options
- Factory lube could be more generous

## Final Thoughts
The Gateron Oil Kings successfully bridge the gap between budget and premium linear switches. They offer that coveted thocky sound signature that many enthusiasts spend considerable time and money trying to achieve through modding cheaper switches.

For newcomers to the hobby looking for their first premium linear experience, or seasoned enthusiasts seeking a reliable daily driver, the Oil Kings deliver exceptional value. The combination of sound, feel, and aesthetics makes them a compelling choice that’s likely to remain relevant in the rapidly evolving mechanical keyboard landscape.

**Bottom Line**: If you’re seeking that deep, satisfying thock in a beautifully designed package, the Gateron Oil Kings are absolutely worth the investment. They’re not the cheapest option available, but the premium experience they deliver justifies the price point for most enthusiasts.
